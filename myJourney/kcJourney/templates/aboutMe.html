        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Kuenzang Choden, and I am currently a 3rd-year B.Ed IT student at Samtse College of Education, where I am completing my teacher training. 
            I am a hardworking student with a strong passion for technology, always eager to explore new tools and ideas.
             I enjoy learning, experimenting with innovations, and applying my skills to real-world challenges in education and IT.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about exploring new technologies and enhancing my IT skills.
             In my free time, I enjoy coding, designing, and learning about web development, as well as engaging in creative projects that challenge me to think differently.</p>
        <p>Beyond technology, I enjoy reading, listening to music, watching anime, learning new languages, and exploring my creativity through art. 
            These activities help me relax, stay inspired, and continuously grow both personally and professionally.</p>
